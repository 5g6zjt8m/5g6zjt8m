## Tools and Technologies
Here are some of the tools and technologies that I have varying degrees of experience in, broken down into categories.

### Networking

These are useful for packet capture and analysis, SSH/serial connections, finding devices on a subnet, discovering blocked/open ports on Windows, and testing out API calls.

### Endpoint/MDM

Many, many hours spent here. Especially with Intune. Sync times are measured in Microsoft Minutesâ„¢. These are all very powerful pieces of software, and I've utilized SCCM and Intune quite extensively. Sophos is an enterprise antivirus that I have created configurations in.

## Certifications

A+ and Network+ certified, next one I'm currently working to achieve is the CCNA.
